# Residential-EE
Software for making inferences about the structural and behavioral drivers of
HVAC demand in buildings. These inferences can be used to compare, in one building, the relative
importance of different loads. Across a set of buildings, these inferences can be used to understand the
likely reasons why one buildingâ€™s usage is extraordinary in the context of the population. This comparison
can be used by an electric utility, for example, to target its outreach and communication efforts based on
an understanding of the most likely drivers of HVAC demand. The example use case is for utilities to
target their residential energy efficiency (EE) incentive programs.
